### Agents ü§ñ

1. **Planner**: overseeing the progress of the task and coordinating with other agents.
2. **Browser**: applying actions on browser with your tools to complete the task.
3. **Researcher**: doing research directly in the web (not in browser) to collect information for the task.
4. **Nothing**: keep up for now just to keep group chat framework.
